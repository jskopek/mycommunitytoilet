At the time of writing, there are now **7,714,576,923** of us. Wow. That growth stat is really hitting me. **_600 MILLION NEW HUMANS SINCE 2014 FOLKS._**

I found the global feces estimates in this article from the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health, Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology entitled “Characterization of Feces and Urine: A Review of Literature to Inform Advanced Treatment Technology” that median feces production is 128 g/cap/day for wet mass, 29 g/cap/day dry mass, and 1.42 L/cap/day urine. 

That’s 157 g/person/day, which equates to:

* 1,211,188,576 kg shit produced by ALL PEOPLE ON EARTH, per day. In other words, 1,211 thousand tonnes per day.


* 1,211 thousand tonnes/day * 365 = 442,015 thousand tonnes per day.

### So as a team, we are producing 442,015 thousand tonnes of feces per year. 

By the same token, we produce **3,998,500,000,000 L of urine per year**.

To put all this into perspective, by 2020 the [FAO](http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6895e.pdf (http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6895e.pdf) projects global fertilizer demand to be 50 210 thousand tonnes, or 1/9th of global feces production.

_Again, to drive this point home: GLOBAL FARMING only uses about **1/9th** of the total fertilizer potential being produced each year by humanity as “waste”._

Given that COSPAR, the Committee on Space Research recommends for NASA to use the same _Hyper-Thermophilic Composting process_ employed by both MYCOmmunity Toilet (soon) and [SOIL]() (presently) to grow crops while terraforming Mars, why don't we do the same on Planet Earth? 

Why do we not make the immediate switch to using our "black gold" or "humanure" as the source of fecundity for our farming productions, and eliminate the need for global fertilizer production and trade in a single year?

It is time we revolutionized sanitation and globally scale the MYCOmmunity Toilet project to have every community on earth growing their own toilets to recycle their waste into healthy fertilizer for farming.
