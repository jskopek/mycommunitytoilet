## the toilet, redesigned

We aim to achieve UN SDG 6: _access to affordable sanitation for all_ *before 2030* by creating a circular, decentralized humanure industry through hyper-thermophilic composting of primary human waste (feces) into healthy, virile soil through community projects around the world. Participating communities will grow the mycelium biocomposite containers.
