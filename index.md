**Over 2.5 billion people lack access to sanitation globally. The effects are felt most profoundly in refugee camps, where high population density, limited resources and inadequate infrastructure create sickness and harmful soil erosion. The MYCOmmunity Toilet is a closed-loop, cradle-to-cradle design dry-composting toilet that uses a designer blend of microbes, enzymes and minerals to safely break down human waste into rich fertilizers.**

**The MYCOmmunity Toilet tank is formed from heat-trapping mycelium biocomposites, ensuring efficient aerobic decomposition of human waste and elimination of pathogens. The fully compostable tank is easily handled and serves as a planter for trees, grasses and crops that stabilize soils and enrich the local environment. By integrating communities across scales from microbes to people, the MYCOmmunity Toilet converts human waste into a valuable resource, empowering its users and improving regional ecosystems.**
