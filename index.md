**The MYCOmmunity Toilet is formed from heat-trapping mycelium biocomposites. This natural material helps rapidly decompose human feces and eliminate pathogens. The fully-compostable tank is easily handled and serves as a planter for trees, grasses and crops that stabilize soils and enrich the local environment. By integrating communities across scales from microbes to people, the MYCOmmunity Toilet converts human waste into a valuable resource, empowering its users and improving regional ecosystems.**
