# we grow toilets.

# use them.

# compost them.

# solve a world problem.

# repeat.

**Each MYCOmmunity Toilet is grown from a heat-trapping mycelium biocomposite. This natural material rapidly decomposes human feces to eliminate pathogens. The fully-compostable tank is easily handled and serves as a planter for trees, grasses and crops that stabilize soils and enrich the local environment. By integrating communities across scales from microbes to people, the MYCOmmunity Toilet converts human waste into a valuable resource, empowering its users and improving regional ecosystems.**
