Three out of ten people worldwide lack access to basic sanitation, resulting in widespread disease, pollution and in some cases threats to human safety, especially to women and children. The MYCOmmunity Toilet is a compostable toilet and sustainable low-cost human waste remediation system. It harnesses microbial and biochemical processes to collect and rapidly convert feces and urine into valuable, safe fertilizers. Made from plant byproducts and mushroom mycelium, the MYCOmmunity Toilet and its contents will naturally decompose over time into fertilizers that can be used to grow trees, grasses and crops, thus stabilizing soils and enriching the local ecosystem.
